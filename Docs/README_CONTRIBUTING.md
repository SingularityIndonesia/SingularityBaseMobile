**Note: Committing changes with side effect**<br/>
If your changes somehow affecting another module that is not associated with your module / scope, and somehow you cannot separate them to separated commits, you must add `!` at the beginning of your commit message and add `ALSO:` to provides the effects.

eg:
```
!fix(LoginScreen): add error handler for MCancelationException.

## TIPS
Create new scope in Appearance & Behavior > Scopes with following pattern:
```
!file[*]:iosApp//*&&!file[*]:.fleet//*&&!file[*]:gradle//*
```
That scopes will make it look better for KMP.

## FAQ
- `#MissingSdk`, `#MissingLocalProperties`, `#LibraryIsNotAnAndroidModule`.

  These issues are known to occur on Windows machines. You need to create a symbolic link from your `local.properties` file to the `Library/` directory. 
  
  **Warning**: Copying the `local.properties` file to the Library project is not recommended.
- `#LaunchError`, `#NoDefaultActivity` `#LaunchingExampleActivity`. To launch the example activity you need to edit launch configuration to launch to a Specific Activity, and set the target to ExampleActivity.
  see: [Launching Specific Activity](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/rundebugconfig?hl=id#:~:text=%3C/intent%2Dfilter%3E-,Specified%20Activity,-%2D%20Meluncurkan%20aktivitas%20aplikasi).
